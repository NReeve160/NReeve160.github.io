            <h2>Hicks Law</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://technoblade.com" target="_blank">Technoblade</a></h2>

                The principal of Hicks law is that the moment a user lands on a website they should
                be able to see what they are on the website for. Technoblade is a popular MineCraft
                Youtuber, the entire purpose of his website is to sell his merchandise. When you first
                land on the website in mobile view immediatly it shows the most recent merchandise
                that is offered on the site. This is the most likely thing that people would be on
                the website for and will give users the immediate option of selecting it. In the case 
                that this is not what they are here for they will be able to quickly and easily scroll
                down for other options of new arrivals, or select the menu bar to choose something else.
                By limiting the options available they have shown exactly what the users are going to 
                be interested in seeing.

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://critroll.com">Critical Role</a></h2>
            <img src="images/critrole.JPG" alt="mobile view of critrole.com" id="criticalrole">
            <p>
                Fitts law states that once landing on the page all relevent information should be
                accessible with minimal movement. Critical Role does a great job of making sure all
                the information is immediatly within reach. The use of the carousel to give more
                information within immediate reach. The most important thing though is that the 
                "latest" episode button is right in the lower middle of the screen. The user can 
                reach that button even if their hand is on the lower part of the phone or holding 
                it from the back.

            <h2>Negative Space</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.naddpod.com">Not Another Dungeons and Dragons Podcast</a></h2>
            <img src="images/naddpod.JPG" alt="mobile view of naddpod.com" id="naddpod">
            <p>
                The negative space here really stands out to emphasize the most important information
                available. This specific section is an introduction to "The Direct Messenger." The 
                negative space is  used as a lighter grey color, which has some simple shapes in 
                side of it. Then the bright and dark colors contrast, which makes them stand out 
                even more distinctly. I especially like the use of the green to emphasize the 
                "Don't @ me!" quote, it stands out so much against the negative space.
