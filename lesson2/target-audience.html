    <h1>Target Audience</h1>
    <h2>A description of the target audience:</h2>
    <p>The target audience is going to match the same audience as Pokemon Go. This will focus on
        young adults between the ages of twenty and thirty. A bias will be towards men who have
        a higher regular log in average than women. There will be some additional focus on locals
        to the Payson Idaho area. 
    </p>
    <h2>Two Personas:</h2>
    <p>Pokemon Go Die hard: this person is someone who is more interested in being up to date on 
        the local Pokemon Go updates. Whether this be a change in gym leadership, a rare pokemon
        being spotted, or special deals on the pokemon game. They will participate in the events
        but the main focus is on the actual game. 
    </p>

    <p>Pokemon Socializer: this person is someone who uses Pokemon Go to get outside and spend 
        time with other people. They are more interested in going to the events in order to find
         other people who share similar interest to them. They want to know where people are going 
         to be gathering, and to see if they can find other people who want to talk with them about
         Pokemon Go.
