                <p>One little cloud is out to-day,
                    One little cloud, and a whole big sky for play—
                    What a big place for a little one,
                    Shine out, you big round sun,
                    Shine out and frighten the little lone cloud, I pray,
                    The sun shone out and the cloud ran away!</p>

                    I know I can't do it on my own
                    While people are fading and changing
                    I'm a permanent fixture, watching, waiting
                    Run your fingers down my back to keep me fixed
                    Eradicate my distractions with every kiss
                    And I'll put my hands to your face</p>

                    Her face was solemn with lost innocence,

                    When others are being so cruel
                    And you can not find someone to know
                    No one there to speak to you

                    Child of the heavens, that falls upon the earth and vast oceans
                    Rain
                    Rain upon the green leaves of trees and wet their trunks and barks.
                    Rain upon the flowers that have blossomed
                    from your mother’s *****.
                    Instill life on lakes and river beds, their streams
                    that dry when you don’t come.</p>

                    Hello there sunrise
                    Your light filters soft
                    As it glows on the skies
                    Good morning, good morning
                    The sweetest fresh air
                    So cool on my face
                    In this moment we share
                    Good morning, good morning
                    Dew drops on the lawn
                    Glistening bright

                <p>More often than Christmas
                    More important than New Years
                    Don’t miss the opportunity when the chance is there
                    A sunset while the burning sand touch our feet and
                    We’re standing so close to the water that it tickles our skin
                    Sometimes it’s two people
                    Two objects
                    Or even two spirits
                    We sit and watch the sunset
                    The sunset that broke our hearts
                    The sunset that stole our first kiss
                    The sunset that took our souls</p>
